                    <p>
                        I have completed courses in linear algebra, computer systems, probability, and statistics as a student at Boston University. 
                        Independently, I learned Python, Java, and C#. In Python, I am experienced with the pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and flask libraries. 
                        In addition, I've used tools like Git, Docker, Azure, and Google Cloud to document and deploy my technical projects. Outside of computer science, I also have intermediate ability with the Adobe Creative Suite, and I have experience managing social media accounts for
                        my clubs and organizations.
