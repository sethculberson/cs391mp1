                        I am a junior at Boston University with a joint major in Statistics and Computer Science and a minor in Economics. 
                        I am also taking masters classes in Earth and Environment. At BU, I'm a member of the <a href="https://sigmachi.org">Sigma Chi</a> Fraternity 
                        and the <a href="https://www.ktpbostonu.com">Kappa Theta Pi</a> Professional Technology Fraternity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I attended The Woodlands Christian Academy in The Woodlands, Texas, for high school. I was part of the basketball, track, 
                        and two time state champion cross country teams. During my senior year, I was awarded the National Merit Scholarship — a scholarship
                        awarded to the top 1% of PSAT test takers — by College Board.
